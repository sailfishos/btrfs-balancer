btrfs-balancer
--------------

btrfs-balancer periodically runs a btrfs balance operation on a devices
filesystem when needed.

It consists of 2 parts:

    * btrfs-balancer utility that checks free space and decides if the balance
      operation is worth running and if so, executes btrfs balance.

    * systemd service files to run btrfs-balancer periodically

Building RPM package with mb script:

    mb2 build -t <your target> rpm/btrfs-balancer.spec
